# Bun Bun Bake Shop
Bun Bun Bake Shop is a local cinnamon roll bakery located in Pittsburgh. Bun Bun Bake Shop sells artisanal flavored cinnamon rolls which come in six different flavors including Original, Original (Gluten Free), Walnut, Caramel Pecan, Pumpkin Spice, and Blackberry. Customers can customize each roll with one of the four different glazing types available: none, vanilla-milk, sugar-milk, and double chocolate. Customers also have the option to create a custom box of cinnamon rolls in which the customers can decide which flavors they want, how many rolls, and the type of glazing on each roll. Customers can customize and place their orders on Bun Bun Bake Shopâ€™s easy to use website guided by a step-by-step process. Given the small-scale business, Bun Bun Bake Shop currently delivers only within the Pittsburgh area.  Giving customers the opportunity to completely customize their order, the unique flavor choices, and the same-day delivery option make Bun Bun Bake Shop a local favorite.
